Assignments details:

1. Implement basic agents on maze environment using: TD-learning, SARSA, SARSA($\lambda$), Q-learning, General Q-learning with theoretical questions.

2.
   - Exploration vs exploitation with multi armed bandits. Using agents: greedy, $\epsilon$-greedy. UCB, REINFORCE, vanilla REINFORCE with theoretical questions.
   - Model-Based, implementing DYNA-Q algorithm on maze problem, comparision to previous assignment.
     
3. Using Deep Q Networks to deal with real games:
   - Cartpole, hold the hammer as long as you can. 
   - Breakout, the classical Atari game with bricks to break.
